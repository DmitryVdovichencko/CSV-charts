# CSV-charts :chart_with_upwards_trend:

This is a project to create simple charts from `.csv` files using d3.js. Now it works with 2 small `.csv` files, which were formatted manually. Also created 2 different Y-axis, styled by css classes 👏🏼 🙏🏼 

## What remains to be done 🔨 ✨:

- [ ] Automatically format `.csv` files from WinCC export 🤖
- [ ] Try to work with big `.csv` files :mag_right:
- [ ] Scaling different axes by user interface :chart_with_downwards_trend: :date: :watch: .
- [ ] Make posibility to add user text on page between charts :memo:
